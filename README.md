# Neo Comic Mono
A legible monospace font... the very typeface you’ve been trained to recognize since childhood. This font is a fork of [Shannon Miwa](https://github.com/shannpersand)’s [Comic Shanns](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns) (version 2) with my small polish additions.

## Building
You need to have nix with flakes enabled installed and run `nix build`.

## Origins
Originaly it was [Comic Mono Font](https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font), but becouse of lack of support of new characters; I created my own fork that is build with Comic Shanns V2 and with small additions of my own characters.
